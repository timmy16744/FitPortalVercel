# WGER Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the WGER API integration for the Ducks Trainer Portal.

## `wger_service.py`

The `wger_service.py` script is responsible for fetching and syncing exercise data from the WGER API. The script was refactored to improve efficiency and reduce the number of API calls.

### Key Changes:

- **Consolidated Data Fetching:** The `fetch_exercises` method was updated to retrieve exercises, categories, muscles, and equipment in a more streamlined way. Instead of making separate calls for each, the script now fetches them sequentially and builds mapping dictionaries to use when transforming the final exercise data.
- **Improved `fetch_exercises`:** The `fetch_exercises` method was updated to directly fetch all required data without making extra calls for images and videos. The API can include this information in the main exercise response, so the script now leverages that to simplify the code and reduce API calls.
- **Refined Data Transformation:** The data transformation logic was adjusted to correctly handle the nested data returned by the API. This includes extracting image URLs and other details directly from the exercise objects.
- **Removed Redundant Functions:** The `fetch_exercise_info`, `fetch_exercise_images`, and `fetch_exercise_videos` functions were removed to simplify the code and improve maintainability.

These changes have resulted in a more efficient and reliable integration with the WGER API. The script now fetches all necessary data in a single, streamlined process, reducing the risk of rate-limiting issues and improving overall performance.
