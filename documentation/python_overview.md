# Python Overview

Python is a powerful, high-level programming language known for its readability, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. It is widely used for backend web development, data science, automation, and more.

## Key Characteristics

* **Readability:** Python's clean, consistent syntax enables concise and maintainable code.
* **Large Standard Library:** Python includes modules for file I/O, networking, concurrency, data serialization, and more, reducing the need for third-party dependencies.
* **Modern Features:** Python 3.9+ supports type hints, async/await for concurrency, dataclasses, and pattern matching (3.10+), enabling robust and scalable applications.
* **Concurrency:** The `concurrent.futures` module provides high-level interfaces for parallelism (threads and processes). Asyncio enables asynchronous I/O for scalable network applications.
* **Community:** Python has a large, active community and a wealth of resources, libraries, and frameworks.

## Python for Web Backends

Python is a popular choice for web backends due to frameworks like Flask (used in this project), Django, and FastAPI. These frameworks leverage Python's strengths:

- Rapid development and prototyping
- Clean integration with databases and APIs
- Strong support for RESTful and real-time (WebSocket) APIs

## Example: Minimal Flask App

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
