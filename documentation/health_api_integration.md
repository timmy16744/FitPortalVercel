# Health API Integration

This document outlines the high-level approach and considerations for integrating with Apple HealthKit and Google Health Connect. Due to the complexity and platform-specific requirements, this section provides a conceptual framework rather than a direct implementation.

## Apple HealthKit Integration

**Requirements:**
-   **Apple Developer Program Enrollment:** The trainer (or the entity deploying the app) *must* be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. This is a strict requirement for accessing HealthKit APIs.
-   **Xcode & iOS Development Environment:** Development and testing will require Xcode on a macOS machine with an iOS device or simulator.
-   **HealthKit Entitlement:** The application's Xcode project must have the HealthKit entitlement enabled.
-   **User Authorization:** The user must explicitly grant permission for the application to read and/or write health data.

**High-Level Steps:**
1.  **Request Authorization:** Implement logic within the iOS application to request user authorization for specific health data types (e.g., steps, heart rate, weight).
2.  **Read Data:** Use `HKHealthStore` to query and retrieve health data from HealthKit.
3.  **Write Data:** (Optional) If the application needs to contribute data to HealthKit, use `HKHealthStore` to save `HKObject` instances.
4.  **Data Synchronization:** Establish a secure and efficient mechanism to synchronize data between the iOS application and the Flask backend. This could involve:
    -   **Direct API Calls:** The iOS app sends data directly to a secure backend endpoint.
    -   **CloudKit Integration:** Utilize Apple's CloudKit for data storage and synchronization, then integrate the backend with CloudKit.

**Data Types to Consider:**
-   Activity (Steps, Active Energy, Exercise Minutes)
-   Body Measurements (Weight, Body Fat Percentage)
-   Heart Rate
-   Sleep Analysis

## Google Health Connect Integration

**Requirements:**
-   **Android Development Environment:** Development and testing will require Android Studio and an Android device or emulator.
-   **Health Connect API:** Integrate with the Health Connect API, which provides a centralized repository for health and fitness data on Android devices.
-   **User Authorization:** Similar to HealthKit, users must grant permissions for data access.

**High-Level Steps:**
1.  **Request Permissions:** Implement logic within the Android application to request user permissions for relevant health data types.
2.  **Read Data:** Use the Health Connect SDK to read data from Health Connect.
3.  **Write Data:** (Optional) Use the Health Connect SDK to write data to Health Connect.
4.  **Data Synchronization:** Establish a secure and efficient mechanism to synchronize data between the Android application and the Flask backend. This would typically involve direct API calls from the Android app to the backend.

**Data Types to Consider:**
-   Activity (Steps, Distance, Calories Expended)
-   Body Measurements (Weight, Body Fat)
-   Heart Rate
-   Sleep

## Backend Considerations for Health API Data

-   **Secure Endpoints:** Create dedicated, secure API endpoints in the Flask backend to receive and store health data from both Apple HealthKit and Google Health Connect.
-   **Data Normalization:** Implement a data model that can accommodate and normalize health data from various sources, ensuring consistency for analysis and display.
-   **User Mapping:** Securely link incoming health data to the correct client profiles in the database.
-   **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Ensure all data handling complies with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and platform-specific guidelines.

## Frontend Display

-   **Unified View:** The client dashboard should present a unified view of health data, regardless of its origin (HealthKit or Health Connect).
-   **Visualization:** Utilize charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to visualize trends in health metrics over time.
-   **Feature Toggling:** The ability to enable/disable Health API integration for individual clients via the trainer dashboard.
