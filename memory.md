**Client Dashboard Enhancements - COMPLETED**

**Summary of Changes:**
- **Frontend:**
    - Refactored `ClientDashboard.js` to use the `useReducer` hook for centralized state management, improving predictability and maintainability.
    - Created `frontend/src/api.js` to centralize all API calls, making data fetching more modular and reusable.
    - Implemented loading and error states within `ClientDashboard.js` to provide better user feedback during data fetching.
    - Enhanced navigation within `ClientDashboard.js` with `react-spring` for smoother, mobile-app-like slide transitions between views.
    - Added Material You-inspired ripple effects to tab buttons and subtle stretch animations for a more polished user experience.
    - Implemented defensive rendering in `DashboardView` to prevent crashes when `todaysTasks` or `client` data is not yet available.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Transitioned from `useState` to `useReducer` for complex state logic to improve scalability and debugging.
- Centralized API calls to `api.js` to promote modularity, reusability, and easier future maintenance/testing of data fetching logic.
- Prioritized user experience by adding explicit loading and error states, and fluid animations for navigation.
