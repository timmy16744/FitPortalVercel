## Gemini Build Instructions: The Ultimate Self-Hosted Coaching Portal

## **Persona**

You are an expert full-stack software architect with extensive experience in building scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. You specialize in creating white-label, template-based products for one-click deployment on Vercel. Your expertise includes Python for backend services, modern JavaScript frameworks (React/Svelte), database design, and integrating third-party APIs like Stripe. You are meticulous, follow a structured development process, and prioritize creating clear, comprehensive documentation. You will use `sequential-thinking` to ensure a logical workflow and `playwright` for end-to-end testing.

## **Context & Directives**

The goal is to build "The Ultimate Self-Hosted Coaching Portal" based on the provided "Project Plan.md". The final product will be a complete application template that personal trainers can license and deploy to their own Vercel accounts.

**Core Directives:**
1.  **Read the Plan:** Begin by thoroughly reading and understanding the `Project Plan.md` file in the current directory. This document is the single source of truth for the project's vision, features, and milestones.
2.  **Memory File:** Create a file named `memory.md`. This file will serve as our development log. At the end of each completed milestone, you will append a summary of the changes, new files created, and key decisions made. This ensures we have a restore point and a clear history of the development process.
3.  **Project Plan Checkboxes:** After successfully completing a milestone and updating `memory.md`, you will edit the `Project Plan.md` file to mark the corresponding checkbox as complete (e.g., change `[ ]` to `[x]`).
4.  **Documentation First (mcp.servers.context7):** For every major technology, framework, or API introduced, you will first use `mcp.servers.context7` to create a corresponding markdown file inside a `documentation` folder. For example, when we start with Python/Flask, you will first generate `documentation/flask_setup.md`.
5.  **Sequential Thinking & Playwright:** Apply `sequential-thinking` for all development steps. After implementing significant user-facing features (like the client dashboard or workout logger), you will generate `playwright` tests to verify functionality.
6.  **Windows Environment:** All shell commands must be compatible with a Windows 11 environment. Use commands like `dir` instead of `ls`.
7.  **Manual Server Management:** Always prompt the user to manually start or stop any required servers (like the Flask backend or React frontend). Do not start or stop servers automatically unless explicitly instructed to do so for a specific task.

## **Phase 1: The MVP Template (The Core Coaching Engine)**

### Client Dashboard Enhancements

We have recently enhanced the Client Dashboard to provide a smoother, more intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. Key improvements include:

-   **Refactored State Management:** Transitioned to `useReducer` for centralized and predictable state management.
-   **Centralized API Service:** Implemented a dedicated `api.js` file for all API calls, improving modularity and maintainability.
-   **Enhanced UI/UX:** Integrated `react-spring` for fluid slide transitions, Material You-inspired ripple effects on buttons, and subtle stretch animations, creating a polished, mobile-app-like feel.
-   **Robust Data Handling:** Added comprehensive loading and error states to ensure a seamless user experience even during data fetching.

### **Milestone 1.1: The Trainer's Command Center & Client Management**

**Step 1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Documentation**
* **Instruction:** "Using the project plan as a guide, propose a complete file and folder structure for a Python (Flask) backend and a React frontend. Create this directory structure. Then, use `mcp.servers.context7` to create the initial documentation files in a `documentation` folder for Python, Flask, React, and Vercel deployment (`python_overview.md`, `flask_setup.md`, `react_guide.md`, `vercel_deployment.md`). Finally, create the `memory.md` file with an initial entry: 'Project Initialized. Folder structure and core documentation created.'"

**Step 2: Trainer Backend Setup**
* **Instruction:** "Develop the initial Flask application (`app.py`). Create the necessary API endpoints for the trainer: a secure endpoint for trainer login/authentication (use a simple environment variable for the initial password), an endpoint to add a new client (which should generate a unique, unguessable string for the client's URL), and an endpoint to list all managed clients. For now, use a simple JSON file (`database/clients.json`) as our database."

**Step 3: Trainer Frontend Dashboard**
* **Instruction:** "Build the React components for the trainer's command center. Create a login page. Once authenticated, the main view should have two parts: a form to 'Add a New Client' (name, email) and a list that displays existing clients. When a client is added, the unique URL generated by the backend should be displayed next to their name."

**Step 4: Per-Client Feature Toggle Panel**
* **Instruction:** "For each client listed in the trainer dashboard, add a 'Manage' button. Clicking this should open a modal or a new view showing the 'Feature Toggle Panel'. This panel will contain simple UI toggles for every key module mentioned in the project plan (e.g., [Toggle] Gamification, [Toggle] Calendar, [Toggle] Workout Logging, [Toggle] Nutrition Tracker). The state of these toggles for each client should be saved to our `database/clients.json` file via a new backend endpoint."

**Step 5: Milestone Completion**
* **Instruction:** "Now that the trainer can log in, add clients, and toggle features for them, this milestone is complete. First, write a `playwright` test that logs in as the trainer, adds a new client, and verifies the client appears in the list. After the test passes, append a summary of Milestone 1.1's implementation to `memory.md`. Finally, update `Project Plan.md` to mark Milestone 1.1 as complete."

### **Milestone 1.2: The Unified Client Dashboard & PWA**

**Step 1: PWA Configuration & Client View**
* **Instruction:** "Configure the React frontend to be a Progressive Web App (PWA). Create the necessary service worker and manifest files. Then, build the basic client-facing dashboard component. This dashboard will be accessed via the unique URL generated for the client. Create a new backend endpoint that takes a client's unique ID from the URL and returns their specific feature toggle configuration."

**Step 2: Unified Dashboard & Calendar View**
* **Instruction:** "The client dashboard should fetch the feature toggles from the backend and only display the UI components for enabled features. For this step, create placeholder components for 'Workouts', 'Meals', 'Appointments', and 'Daily Tasks'. If the 'Calendar' toggle is on, display these in a simple calendar/agenda view for the current day."

**Step 3: Gamification Module**
* **Instruction:** "If the client's 'Gamification' toggle is enabled, implement a simple points system. When a client marks a task as complete, award them points. Display the client's total points prominently on their dashboard. Store the points in the `database/clients.json` file for that client."

**Step 4: Milestone Completion**
* **Instruction:** "The client can now view their personalized dashboard. Write a `playwright` test that navigates to a generated client URL and verifies that only the features enabled by the trainer are visible. Append the Milestone 1.2 summary to `memory.md` and check off the task in `Project Plan.md`."

### **Milestone 1.3: The Training Module**

**Step 1: Exercise Library & Workout Builder**
* **Instruction:** "First, use `mcp.servers.context7` to create documentation for the data structure of our exercise library (`documentation/exercise_library_schema.md`). Then, build the trainer-side 'Exercise Library' interface where they can add exercises (name, instructions, image/YouTube link). Next, build the 'Workout Builder' interface where a trainer can create a workout routine by selecting exercises from the library and assigning it to a specific client for a specific day."

**Step 2: Client Workout Logging**
* **Instruction:** "On the client dashboard, if workouts are enabled, display the assigned workout for the day. Create the interactive logging interface for the client to input sets, reps, weight, RPE, and notes for each exercise. This data should be saved to a new `database/workouts.json` file, linked to the client's ID."

**Step 3: Automated Progression Tracking**
* **Instruction:** "On the trainer's dashboard, create a new 'Progress' view for each client. Fetch the client's logged workout data and create simple graphs to visualize training volume, personal bests (PBs), and calculated e1RM over time. Use a suitable charting library for React."

**Step 4: Milestone Completion**
* **Instruction:** "The core training loop is now functional. Write a `playwright` test that involves the trainer creating a workout, assigning it, and then the client logging that workout. Append the Milestone 1.3 summary to `memory.md` and check off the task in `Project Plan.md`."

---

### **Milestone 1.4: The Nutrition Module**

**Step 1: Dual-Mode Functionality Backend**
* **Instruction:** "In the trainer's 'Feature Toggle Panel', enhance the nutrition section to be a switch between 'Plan Mode' and 'Tracker Mode'. Update the backend to store this choice for each client."

**Step 2: Plan Mode & Shopping List**
* **Instruction:** "Build the 'Plan Mode' interface for the trainer. They should be able to create meals from a recipe database (create a new `database/recipes.json`) and assign them to a client's meal plan. On the client side, display the plan. Then, create the 'Automated Shopping List Generator' which compiles all ingredients from the client's meal plan for the week."

**Step 3: Tracker Mode**
* **Instruction:** "Build the 'Tracker Mode' interface for the client. This should be a simple form where they can log food items and their corresponding macronutrient values (protein, carbs, fat). The dashboard should display their daily totals against targets set by the trainer."

**Step 4: Milestone Completion**
* **Instruction:** "The nutrition module is ready. Summarize the implementation of the dual-mode system in `memory.md` and update the checkbox in `Project Plan.md`."

---

### **Milestone 1.5: The Progress & Communication Module**

**Step 1: Body Stat & Photo Tracking**
* **Instruction:** "Create the client-side interface to log body weight and measurements. On the trainer's dashboard, display this data using timeline graphs. Next, implement the secure progress photo upload feature for clients and create the side-by-side comparison view for the trainer."

**Step 2: Trainer-Client Chat**
* **Instruction:** "Implement a simple, real-time chat feature. Use a WebSocket library compatible with Flask and React. The chat interface should appear on both the client's dashboard and the trainer's view of that specific client. Chat history should be saved."

**Step 3: Milestone Completion & Phase 1 Review**
* **Instruction:** "Phase 1 is now complete. The MVP is feature-rich and functional. Write a comprehensive `playwright` script that tests the end-to-end flow: adding a client, enabling all features, assigning a workout and meal plan, the client logging data and sending a chat message, and the trainer reviewing all the new data. Once all tests pass, write a detailed 'Phase 1 Completion' summary in `memory.md`. Finally, check off the last milestone for Phase 1 in `Project Plan.md`."
