Project Plan: The Ultimate Self-Hosted Coaching Portal
1. Project Goal & Vision

To create a comprehensive, white-label coaching portal template that personal trainers can purchase via a one-time license key. The trainer will self-host the application on their own Vercel account and use their own custom domain, providing a premium, app-like experience for their clients with zero ongoing fees paid to the developer.
2. Core Philosophy

    Trainer Ownership: The trainer has full control and ownership of their platform, code, and client data. There is no dependency on a central service.

    Client Simplicity: The client experience is paramount. It must be frictionless, intuitive, and motivating, requiring no logins, passwords, or app store downloads.

    100% White-Label: The developer's brand is completely invisible on the final, deployed product.

3. Business Model & Technology

    Product: A one-time license fee for a lifetime license to use the application template.

    Hosting: The trainer is responsible for their own hosting costs (leveraging Vercel's generous free tier) and domain registration fees.

    Technology: A Progressive Web App (PWA) built with a modern web framework (e.g., Python backend, React/Vue/Svelte frontend).

    Deployment: The project will be structured as a template for one-click deployment on Vercel.

Phase 1: The MVP Template (The Core Coaching Engine)

Goal: Build a complete, feature-rich, and saleable application template.
Milestone 1.1: The Trainer's Command Center & Client Management

    [x] Develop the core trainer-facing dashboard.

    [x] Implement the ability to add/manage clients, which generates a unique, private URL for each client.

    [x] Build the per-client Feature Toggle Panel, allowing the trainer to intuitively enable/disable every key module for each client (e.g., [Toggle] Enable Gamification, [Toggle] Show Calendar).

Milestone 1.2: The Unified Client Dashboard & PWA

    [x] Create the seamless client-facing interface, functioning as an installable PWA.

    [x] Develop the unified Dashboard & Calendar view, showing workouts, meals, appointments, and daily tasks at a glance.

    [x] Implement optional Gamification (points for completed tasks) that can be toggled by the trainer.

Milestone 1.3: The Training Module

    [x] Build the trainer-side Workout Builder.

    [x] Create a comprehensive Exercise Library with support for images, YouTube links, and trainer-uploaded videos.

    [x] Implement the interactive Client Workout Logging for sets, reps, weight, RPE, and notes.

    [x] Develop Automated Progression Tracking to calculate and graph volume, personal bests (PBs), and estimated 1-Rep Max (e1RM).

Milestone 1.4: The Nutrition Module

    [x] Implement the Dual-Mode Functionality, allowing trainers to switch clients between:

        Plan Mode: A trainer-built meal plan using a recipe database.

        Tracker Mode: A simple macro tracker for the client to self-log.

    [x] Create the Automated Shopping List Generator based on the trainer's selected meals.

Milestone 1.5: The Progress & Communication Module

    [x] Develop comprehensive Body Stat Tracking (weight, measurements) with visual timeline graphs.

    [x] Implement Secure Progress Photo uploads with a side-by-side comparison view.

    [x] Build a simple, two-way Trainer-Client Chat feature within the portal.

Phase 2: Business & Licensing Infrastructure

Goal: Build the system to sell, license, and deliver the template from Phase 1.
Milestone 2.1: Marketing & Sales Website

    [x] Design and build a simple, professional website to advertise the template, showcase its features, and act as the point of sale.

Milestone 2.2: Payment & License Key System

    [x] Integrate Stripe to handle secure one-time payments.

    [x] Build a backend system to:

        Generate a unique, cryptographic license key upon successful purchase.

        Store and manage active license keys in a database.

        Create a simple, secure API endpoint that the deployed template can call once on its initial startup to validate the license key.

Milestone 2.3: Deployment & Documentation

    [x] Structure the final application code as a GitHub template.

    [x] Create the "Deploy to Vercel" button for the purchase confirmation page.

    [x] Write clear, concise documentation for the trainer, covering:

        The one-click deployment process.

        Where to input their license key during Vercel's setup.

        How to connect their custom domain in their Vercel dashboard.

Phase 3: V2 Features (Advanced Upgrade) - COMPLETED

Goal: Enhance the template with premium features that could justify a new version or higher-priced license.
Milestone 3.1: The Business Hub Expansion

    [x] Prospect Management: Add functionality for the trainer to manage leads before they become active clients.

    [x] Resource Hub: Allow trainers to upload and share documents (PDFs, guides) with their clients.

Milestone 3.2: Deeper Health Insights

    [x] Holistic Habit Tracking: Add a daily check-in section for clients to log metrics like sleep quality, stress levels, and motivation.

    [x] Health API Integration: Build the modules to connect to Apple HealthKit and Google Health Connect.

        Note: Documentation must clearly state that Apple integration requires the trainer to enroll in the Apple Developer Program.

Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements

    [x] Implement a basic UI/UX for the entire project using React-Bootstrap.

Phase 5: Future Roadmap (Post-Launch Vision)

Goal: Plan for the long-term evolution of the product.

    [x] Community & Group Coaching: Features for managing client groups, running group challenges, and creating leaderboards.

    [x] Advanced Trainer Automation: "Red Flag" alerts for client non-adherence and fully automated client onboarding sequences.

    [x] Direct-to-Client Program Sales: A feature allowing trainers to use their portal to sell standalone, non-coached programs.
